## Special Considerations

### **Photographs**
Historical photographs (1920s-1970s) in this archive are rare primary sources. Many are the only surviving copies. While we encourage their use for education and research:

- **Always attribute** the Souvannavong Family Archive
- **Provide context** - include dates, names, and historical significance when known
- **Request permission** for publication, exhibition, or commercial use
- **Maintain dignity** - these are family members and historical figures

### **Personal Information**
This archive includes:
- Family genealogical data across four generations
- Personal correspondence and oral history
- Names, dates, and biographical details

**Privacy considerations:**
- Living family members' personal information should be handled respectfully
- Do not use for purposes unrelated to historical research or education
- Contact information should not be harvested or redistributed

### **Historical Accuracy**
We strive for accuracy but acknowledge:
- Some dates are approximate due to limited French colonial records
- Personal names may have multiple Romanization spellings
- New archival materials may refine our understanding over time

**Found an error?** Please [contact us](/contact/) with supporting documentation.
