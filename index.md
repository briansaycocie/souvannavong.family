# The Souvannavong Family of Laos
## Royal Service, Diplomacy, and Diaspora (1898-Present)

*Prepared for the Souvannavong Family*

This comprehensive history documents the **Souvannavong family**, with particular focus on **Outhong (also spelled Oudong or Oudom) Souvannavong**, a senior statesman of the Kingdom of Laos, royal advisor to King Savang Vatthana, and a key participant in the King's official state visit to Japan in August 1970.

## Introduction

This report preserves family history that survived political collapse, war, and exile. It contextualizes family-held photographs and documents within verified historical events, and formally records the life and service of Outhong Souvannavong, whose contributions to Lao governance and diplomacy were largely erased after 1975.

Compiled from family-held artifacts, photographs, oral history from living Souvannavong family members residing in Minnesota, and international archival sources.
