# Appendix D: Source Notes and Archival References

This appendix documents the sources used in the preparation of this report. Due to the destruction, loss, or non-digitization of many official records of the Kingdom of Laos following 1975, this report necessarily integrates **family-held primary materials** with **international archival sources** and **secondary historical scholarship**.

Where exact citations are unavailable, source context and corroboration are noted.

## I. Family-Held Primary Sources

The following materials are preserved by the Souvannavong family and constitute **primary historical evidence**:

### 1. Photographic Collection (c. 1960s–1970s)
- Original photographs depicting:
  - Private royal audiences
  - Official arrival ceremonies in Japan
  - Expo '70 events in Osaka
  - Cultural, religious, and industrial visits
  - State banquets
- Photographs preserved across:
  - Australia
  - The United States (Minnesota)

These images show consistent participation of senior Lao advisors alongside the King and Queen and form the core evidentiary basis for reconstructing delegation composition.

---

### 2. Japanese Government Commemorative Folder (1970)
- French-language folder titled:

  *"En souvenir de la visite officielle de Sa Majesté le Roi Sri Savang Vatthana et Sa Majesté la Reine Tiao Khamphouy du Laos – du 11 au 15 août 1970 – Gouvernement du Japon"*

- Confirms:
  - Official status of the visit
  - Dates: 11–15 August 1970
  - Issuing authority: Government of Japan

Distribution of such materials was restricted to official delegation members and senior participants.

---

### 3. Military Biographical Panel: Captain Oukham Souvannavong
- Identifies:
  - Captain Oukham Souvannavong
  - Royal Lao Air Force
  - C-47 flight engineer / aircraft mechanic
  - Circa 1965

This panel confirms military service and technical specialization within the Royal Lao Air Force.

---

### 4. Oral Family History
- Accounts provided by Ouladay Saycocie (Souvannavong) and extended family members
- Includes:
  - Identification of individuals in photographs
  - Migration and exile pathways
  - Preservation of documents in Australia and Minnesota

## II. Official and Archival Records (International)

### 1. Imperial Household Agency of Japan (宮内庁)
- Registry of foreign royal visitors
- Confirms presence of:
  - King Savang Vatthana
  - Queen Khamphouy

---

### 2. Expo '70 Official Records (Osaka, Japan)

- Public attendance and official programming logs

---

### 3. Japanese Press Archives
- Asahi Shimbun

Photographic and written coverage of the Lao royal visit exists but focuses primarily on the King and Queen. Delegation members are rarely named in captions.

---

### 4. United States Government Records
- U.S. Department of State cables (Foreign Relations of the United States – FRUS)
- References to:

---

### 5. French Archival Sources
- Colonial and post-colonial administrative records
- French-language ministerial and diplomatic documents
- French served as the primary administrative language of the Lao state until 1975

---

## III. Secondary Scholarly Sources

### 1. Academic Works
- *Historical Dictionary of Laos*
- Studies on Lao elite families and royal governance
- Research on Cold War diplomacy in Southeast Asia

These works confirm:
- The structure of the King's Council
- The role of the President of the King's Council
- Patterns of ministerial service and royal advisory authority

---

### 2. Memoirs and Family Histories
- Published recollections by members of prominent Lao families
- Diaspora memoirs referencing royal-era governance and exile

Such sources provide contextual insight but are used cautiously and cross-referenced.

---

## IV. Methodological Notes

- Many Lao state records were destroyed or rendered inaccessible after 1975.
- Military personnel files for Royal Lao Air Force technical staff were rarely digitized.
- Delegation lists for royal visits were often not published publicly.

Accordingly, this report relies on:
- Converging lines of evidence
- Role-based inference grounded in documented protocol
- Photographic consistency across multiple official contexts

No conclusions are drawn from a single source alone.

---

- President of the King's Council (1965–1975)
- Former Ambassador to Japan
- Senior advisor accompanying the King during the 1970 Japan visit

is supported by:
- Family-held primary materials
- Confirmed historical timelines
