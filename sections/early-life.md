# Section II: Outhong Souvannavong - Early Life and Formation (1898-1945)

Outhong Souvannavong was born on **23 September 1898 in Vientiane**, then part of French Indochina. He came from a prominent Lao family whose members traditionally served in administration, law, and royal governance.

He received a French colonial education, studying in Phnom Penh and Saigon, and earned a bachelor's degree. This educational background placed him among a small elite class of Lao administrators capable of navigating both traditional royal structures and modern bureaucratic governance.

By the early 1940s, Outhong had entered senior public service. In **1941** (age 43), he was appointed **Governor of Thakhek**, a strategically important province in central Laos. In **1942** (age 44), he rose to become **Minister of Finance and Education**, a combined portfolio reflecting the monarchy's emphasis on economic modernization and elite education.

Unlike revolutionary or separatist figures, Outhong aligned himself with the royal government and constitutional monarchy, positioning himself as a stabilizing technocrat rather than a partisan ideologue.
