# Section III: National Leadership and Ministerial Service (1946-1964)

Following Laos's independence, Outhong Souvannavong became one of the most consistently appointed figures in government.

Between **1947 and 1954** (ages 49-56), he served in nearly every Lao cabinet, holding multiple ministerial posts including:

- Finance
- Interior
- Defense
- Foreign Affairs
- Education
- Information
- Public Health

His repeated appointment across changing governments indicates that he was viewed as politically neutral, administratively competent, and personally loyal to the King.

By the early 1960s, he had become widely regarded as an elder statesman, increasingly consulted rather than publicly visible.
