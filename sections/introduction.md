# Section I: Introduction and Purpose

This report documents the history of the **Souvannavong family**, with particular focus on **Outhong (also spelled Oudong or Oudom) Souvannavong**, a senior statesman of the Kingdom of Laos, royal advisor to King Savang Vatthana, and a key participant in the King's official state visit to Japan in August 1970.

The purpose of this report is threefold:

1. To preserve family history that survived political collapse, war, and exile
2. To contextualize family-held photographs and documents within verified historical events
3. To formally record the life and service of Outhong Souvannavong, whose contributions to Lao governance and diplomacy were largely erased after 1975

This account draws upon original photographs preserved by the family, Japanese government commemorative materials, military biographical records of Captain Oukham Souvannavong, and international historical archives.

Where primary documentation is incomplete due to historical disruption, conclusions are drawn carefully using corroborated evidence and established historical context.
